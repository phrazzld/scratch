| ID | Summary |
|---|---|
| [automation](./automation.md) | Automation reduces manual error, ensures consistency, frees up developer time, provides faster feedback, and makes processes repeatable and reliabl... |
| [document-decisions](./document-decisions.md) | Code mechanics change; comments detailing "how" quickly become outdated or redundant. The reasoning behind decisions provides enduring value. Self-... |
| [explicit-over-implicit](./explicit-over-implicit.md) | Explicit code is easier to understand, reason about, debug, and refactor safely. Implicit behavior obscures dependencies, hinders tracing, and lead... |
| [maintainability](./maintainability.md) | Most development time is spent reading/maintaining existing code, not writing new code. Premature optimization often adds complexity, obscures inte... |
| [modularity](./modularity.md) | Modularity tames complexity, enables parallel development, independent testing/deployment, reuse, fault isolation, and easier evolution. Properly m... |
| [no-secret-suppression](./no-secret-suppression.md) | Quality gates and static analysis tools are critical safeguards that help prevent defects and maintain consistent code quality. Suppressing these s... |
| [simplicity](./simplicity.md) | Simplicity is not just a goal but a fundamental requirement for building high-quality, maintainable software. Simple code is easier to understand, ... |
| [testability](./testability.md) | Automated tests build confidence, prevent regressions, enable safe refactoring, and act as executable documentation. Code difficult to test often i... |
